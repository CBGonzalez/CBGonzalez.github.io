Here is a detail of St. John's cathedral in Den Bosch, The Netherlands.

A view from above, from [Wikipedia](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luchtboogbeelden_Sint-Jan) (in Dutch including several more pictures) shows more of the 96 figures present in total on the arches.

I first saw the figures in a picture shown in the [city museum](https://www.hetnoordbrabantsmuseum.nl/) while visiting another exposition . I was shocked by the images.

All those people sitting on the roof of a church, as if on a conveyor belt, waiting to go to heaven? ... or waiting to talk to god? ... or just waiting? ... while horrendous animals seem to block further ascent. Pretty strong imagery, revolting too in a certain level.

The roof decoration was finished around 1510, a few years before the christian [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation), when the roman religion was the only one tolerated in most of Europe. The people depended on the church and their representatives for their beliefs and rites and almost anything else in their daily lives, the scriptures were in Latin, inaccessible to the common folks.

One can only wonder what the intention or the intended symbolism of the roof figures were back then. Hard to find some positive way to look at it.
